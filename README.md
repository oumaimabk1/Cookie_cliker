## Cookie Clicker
Cookie Clicker is a simple and addictive game in which the player clicks a button labeled "manette" in order to increase their score.  

The player starts with a score of 0 and can increase it by clicking the "manette" button.  
The player can also purchase various options (Price increases by 2x with each purchase) to temporarily increase their score, such as:  
•	X : Each click is worth 2 points for 30 seconds.   
•	Y : Each click is worth 4 points for 30 seconds.
•	Auto: Score increases by 10 every second for 30 seconds.
